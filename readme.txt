The B_ variants use the possibility to save the input texts in a variable file in 
order to then read them out again with another python script. This is currently 
just a slightly more cumbersome way, but could become relevant in the future if 
we get new chips that enable us to work with WLAN or Bluetooth or if we still want to work 
with an html page via which the entries are made could.

Otherwise, the other scripts (not marked with B_) are of course sufficient 
to describe the badger via a terminal entry from Thonny IDE.
